## ðŸ“Š How to Run CAUSE_tomo?

To train CAUSE_tomo from scratch, please first edit [`CAUSE_tomo/config/config.yaml`](/config/config.yaml) and set there all the required parameters

Then you can run the following:

```shell script
python train.py
```
At the end of each run, in [`outputs`](/outputs/) will be created a new log

To monitor training with tensorboard run the following from `CAUSE_tomo` directory:

```shell script
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

### Bringing your own data

To train CAUSE_tomo on your own dataset please specify in [`CAUSE_tomo/config/config.yaml`](/config/config.yaml) set the following parameters:

```yaml
data_dir: "directory"
dataset: "dataset_name"
```
